== Still Alive Exerciser

This application is a simple one hosted to give us a controlled environment to test the StillAlive
script runner constantly.

The idea is to have a StillAlive script running against this application which tests live every
possible type of StillAlive parser.

Edge cases can then be implemented into this as needed.

This does not replace the unit tests by any means.  But does give us a live "smoke test" for 
StillAlive proper.
